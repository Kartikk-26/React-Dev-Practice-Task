You will find various projects focusing on building reusable components, implementing state management, and handling real-world application scenarios.

## ⚡ React + Vite

This template uses **React** with **Vite**, which provides a minimal and fast setup with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules for code quality.

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available for React development:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Vite ensures a faster development experience, especially with large projects, making it ideal for modern React applications.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before getting started with the projects in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm** : React development requires Node.js and npm. Install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
